    <p>The OSU Security Club was founded in September, 2014 by Daniel Reichert, and is guided
by <a href="https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~rosulekm/">Dr. Mike Rosulek</a>.
We focus on gaining hands-on experience with vulnerabilities and 
attacks at both system and networking levels, and getting involved in the security community. 
There's no experience or knowledge required, only an interest in learning more about
this incredibly important and expanding field!    
<p>If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please send us an 
<a href="mailto:security.club@oregonstate.edu">email</a>, or ask an @Officer on our <a href="http://discord.gg/bf4svqC">Discord Server</a></p>
